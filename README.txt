Tested on Node version 18.8.0 and Linux operation system (using openstack instance)

To download node modules execute: npm install

Then start the server by executing: node server.js

To test go to: http://localhost:3000/form

Note:
If you visit some of the other routes before registering you are redirected to http://localhost:3000/form
An error is printed to the console about how the headers have already been sent but this does not stop the server or affect the functionality of the app.
