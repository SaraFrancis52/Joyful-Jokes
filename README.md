# COMP 2406 - Term Project

This project queries an API to generate random jokes for the user. The user can then save the jokes to a database and view all the saved jokes. Joyful Jokes was created for my term project of the web development course (COMP 2406) I took at Carleton in Fall 2022. 

Tested on Node version 18.8.0 and Linux operation system

To download node modules execute: `npm install`

Then start the server by executing: `node server.js`

To test go to: `http://localhost:3000/form`
